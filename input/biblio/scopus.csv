However, many researchers argued that N and P are the only yield-limiting nutrients. The current study was conducted to identify yield-limiting nutrients for tef and to assess the inherent nutrient supplying status of Vertisols. The experiments were carried out during the 2020/2021cropping season under screen house, on-station, and on-farm conditions at Yilmana Densa district of Amhara region, Ethiopia. Tef (Quncho variety) was used as a test crop. This trial contained ten treatments including: control, PKSZnB, NKSZnB, NPSZnB, NPKZnB, NPKSB, NPKSZn, NPKSZnB, NP, and NPS. Each pot with a height of 0.185 m and volume of 0.186 m3 was filled with 5 kg of soil which was taken from 0 to 20 cm depth by auger. The pot trial was laid out in a completely randomized design (CRD), while the field trials were laid out in a completely randomized block design (RCBD) with three replications. The gross plot area was 7.5 m2 for field experiments. Yield-limiting nutrients were identified through a nutrient omission trial. The data were analyzed using SAS version 9.0, and significant treatment means were separated by using LSD at P ≤ 0.05. The nutrient contents of the soils determined from the composite samples collected before planting indicated that TN (0.126% on-station and 0.125% on-farm) was low. The Av.P (3.89 mg kg−1on-station and 4.24 mg kg−1 on-farm) content of the soil was also very low. The result revealed that omission of N and P highly significantly (P < 0.01) reduced grain yield, straw yield, and yield components of tef in all experiments. The results were affected by inadequate supply of N and P nutrients. However, the absence of potassium, sulfur, zinc, and boron did not show significant (P < 0.05) yield reduction. The lowest grain and biomass yields (2.2 and 7.9 g/pot under greenhouse), (177.2 and 533.3 kg ha−1 on-station), and (24.9 and 533.3 kg ha−1 on-farm), respectively, were recorded from omission of N. The low yield of tef mainly caused by poor soil fertility. As a result of N and P omissions, grain yield decreased by 81.6% and 80.7% on-station, by 96.5% and 85.2% on-farm, and by 58.0% and 54.2% in the pot experiment, respectively. In addition, omission of P also resulted in significant grain and biomass yields (2.4 and 8.1 g/pot under screenhouse), (191.1 and 1066.7 kg ha−1 on-station), and (106.4 and 533.3 kg ha−1 on-farm), respectively. Application of K, S, Zn, and B did not have any effect on tef yield over the applied NP. The uptake of N, P, K, S, Zn, and B by tef grain and straw was low in N and P nutrient omissions. Based on these results, N and P were identified as the most yield-limiting nutrients. Application of NP is better than K, S, Zn, and B containing fertilizers for tef production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Nitrogen; Omission; Phosphorus; Pot; Tef; Trial","","Adet Agricultural Research Center; Bahir Dar University College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences; Debere Birhan Agricultural Research Center; Amhara Regional Agricultural Research Institute, ARARI","The authors acknowledge Adet Agricultural Research Center and Amhara Agricultural Research Institute (ARARI) for providing financial support and study grant, Debere Birhan Agricultural Research Center for facilitating laboratory analysis and Bahir Dar University College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences.

Although tree-crop systems generate multiple economic and ecological benefits, tree-crop competition commonly occurs. We hypothesized that mineral fertilizers affect facilitative and competitive interactions differently in tree-crop systems. Methods: Tree-crop-fertilizer interactions were explored for wheat growing under Faidherbia albida, and maize growing under Acacia tortilis and Grevillea robusta through omission trials of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in open fields and fields under tree canopy, using a split plot design. The experiments were conducted in Ethiopia and Rwanda, replicated four times, and over two seasons. Results: Our results demonstrated that the presence of F. albida significantly improved N and P use efficiencies, leading to significantly higher (P < 0.001) grain yields in wheat. This tree species contributed around 64 kg ha−1 yr.−1 of mineral N. The P use efficiency of wheat under F. albida was double that of open field wheat. By contrast, G. robusta and A. tortilis trees lowered nutrient use efficiencies in maize, leading to significantly less maize grain yields compared with open fields receiving the same fertilization. Probabilities of critically low crop yields and crop failure were significantly greater for maize growing under the canopy of these species. Conclusions: Our results showed that recommended fertilizer rates led to facilitative interaction only with F. albida, highlighting that fertilizer recommendations need to be adapted to agroforestry systems. © 2019, The Author(s).","Agronomic use efficiency; Competition; Crop failure; Facilitation; Mineral fertilizer; Tree-crop interaction","Ethiopia; Rwanda; Acacia tortilis; Grevillea robusta; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; agricultural intensification; agroforestry; competition (ecology); crop yield; dicotyledon; economic analysis; experimental design; fertilizer application; maize; nitrogen; nutrient use efficiency; phosphorus; smallholder; wheat","CIMMYT; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR; Wageningen University, (FSC/2012/014)"," This work was implemented by CIMMYT and Wageningen University as part of the project ‘Trees for Food Security’ (FSC/2012/014), made possible by the generous support of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), CRP MAIZE ( www.maize.org ) and CRP WHEAT ( www.wheat.org ).

We assessed the key field-scale cause of variability in maize (Zea mays) grain yield response to fertilizer nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the Sidindi area of Western Kenya based on past manure application, distance from the homestead, and clay and silt contents. We used data from nutrient omission trials conducted on 23 farms over seven consecutive cropping seasons covering the period 2013–2016, without changing treatments or plot location. Treatments included a control and PK, NK, NP and NPK. Accounting for past manure application increased the explained variability in maize yield, and yield response to N, P, and K application. Mean treatment maize grain yield in the control, PK, NK, NP and NPK treatments were 1.0, 2.2, 1.5, 2.9 and 4.5 t ha                             −1                              at 88% dry matter respectively in fields without past manure application, and 2.4, 2.7, 4.4, 4.9 and 5.4 t ha                             -1                              in fields which had received animal manure in at least two out of three seasons prior to the start of the trials. Mean maize yield response to N, P and K application was 2.3, 3.0 and 1.6 t ha                             −1                              respectively in fields without past manure application, and 2.8, 1.1 and 0.6 t ha                             −1                              in fields with past manure application. In the seventh cropping season, past animal manure application contributed a fertilizer equivalent of 28.3, 29.8 and 31.5 kg ha                             −1                              of N, P and K, respectively. At both the onset and at the start of the last season, fields with past animal manure application had on average higher contents of SOC, available P and exchangeable K, yet differences were not always significant within treatments. Accounting for past animal manure application reduces crop fertilizer requirements for P and K as well as decreasing uncertainty in yield response to fertilizer. We conclude that the strong influence of past animal manure application on yield response to fertilizer application merits the inclusion of past manure application as a co-variate in analysis of yield response data from smallholder cropping systems of SSA.                          © 2019","Past manure application; Sub-Saharan Africa; Yield response to fertilizers","Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa; Animalia; Zea mays; crop production; cropping practice; dry matter; fertilizer application; maize; manure; smallholder; soil nutrient; yield response","International Plant Nutrition Institute, IPNI","This study was facilitated through funding from Agrium to the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) , for research on 4R Nutrient Stewardship in western Kenya.

It is expected that these maize fields will gradually become depleted and more K will be required to maintain or improve yields. Research goals were set for sandy soils in the main maize producing areas of South Africa to determine the lower & upper threshold values and sufficiency levels for soil K, the K status of these soils and to evaluate the sufficiency level concept for K at the various localities in the Free State Province. Field experiments were conducted at nine localities during four consecutive seasons. The experimental data included the soil K extracted with NH4OAc and the relative maize yields (RY) of the treatments, +K which received macro, secondary and micro nutrients and 0K which received the same nutrients but K was omitted. The results indicated a lower threshold value of 125 mg K kg−1 below which maize is expected to respond positively and an upper threshold value of 190 mg K kg−1 above which maize is expected not respond to additional K. The extractable K from 25 000 sandy soil samples received from maize farmers indicated that approximately 50% of these samples contained less K than the lower threshold value, approximately 30% was between the lower and upper threshold values and the remaining 20% was above the upper threshold value. The sufficiency levels obtained with the Mitscherlich model at 98% RY, ranged from 109–340 mg K kg−1. The difference between the sufficiency values and the extractable soil K at any of these localities, gives an unbiased measurement of the K fertilizer to be recommended. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Maize; Potassium; Relative yield; Sufficiency; Threshold values","Africa; Free State; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays; crop production; crop yield; experimental study; fertilizer application; maize; modeling; potassium; sandy soil; threshold","","","J.J. van Biljon; Omnia Fertilizers, Bryanston, 2021, P.O.

This on-farm study was conducted in 2019 and 2020 to determine yield-limiting nutrients, quantify yield gaps, and determine indigenous soil nutrient supply (ISNS) for lowland rice in Fogera floodplain of Northwest Ethiopia. The study comprised the following treatments; NPKSZnB, -N (PKSZnB), -P (NKSZnB), -K (NPSZnB), -S (NPKZnB), -Zn (NPKSB), -B (NPKSZn), and Zero fertilizer (F0). The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design considering farmers’ fields as replications. The results revealed that the growth and yield of rice were significantly affected by the -N and F0 treatments. However, the other nutrient omissions did not significantly influence the mentioned parameters. The highest (2299.5 kg ha−1) yield response was recorded from the -N treatment. However, very low and insignificant yield responses were recorded from the other nutrient omissions. The average agronomic N use efficiency was 16.7 kg kg−1, which indicated a high probability of yield response to the application of N fertilizer. The lowest (42.4%) ISNS was found for N, while the highest ISNS (>90%) were recorded for P, K, S, Zn, and B. The yield gaps due to the omission of N was 57.6%, while the yield gaps due to the omission of P, K, S, Zn, and B were very low. Therefore, N was found to be the most yield-limiting and most deficient nutrient for the lowland rice production in the study area. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Fertilizer; Fogera; nitrogen; nutrient omission; phosphorus; potassium; rice; yield gaps; yield response","","","","A.G.

In this study, we assessed maize response to applied nutrients and nutrient use efficiency in different management zones (MZs), for designing site-specific nutrient management recommendations for maize in the maize belt of Nigeria. The maize belt in Nigeria was earlier delineated into four MZsMZs (MZ1 to MZ4) based on soil properties. In the current study, data from two different trials, nutrient omission trials (N = 293) and fertilizer response trial (N = 705), conducted in the years 2015-2017, were extracted for MZ1 to MZ3; to analyze maize yield responses to application of N, P and K, and secondary and micro-nutrients. Maize yield response to K application was only positive in MZ1. Responses to N and P application were positive for all MZs. However, the magnitude of maize response to P varied between the MZs, indicating a differentiation in the degree to which P is limiting maize production in the study area. Average nitrogen requirement was higher for MZ3 (138 kg ha-1), than for MZ2 and MZ1 (121 and 83 kg ha-1, respectively). Average P requirement was higher for MZ3 (45 kg ha-1) than for the other zones. Potassium requirement was 26% and 28% higher in MZ2 and MZ3 compared with MZ1 ( 1/415 kg ha-1). The use of the specific nutrient rates for the MZs may reduce risks and uncertainties in crop production. The delineated MZs of the maize belt of Nigeria that incorporates spatial variability in soil fertility conditions are useful for nutrient management for larger areas.  © 2022 The Author(s).

However, dramatic shifts to high-analysis NPK fertilizers containing little or no S and restriction on sulphur dioxide emissions by industries lowered the coincidental input of S. At the same time continuous crop- ping and higher-yielding cultivars removed more S which led to low S levels in cultivated soils. The aim of this study was to determine the threshold value for S and to evaluate the S-levels in soils of the main maize-growing areas of South Africa. In order to determine the critical sulphur content in these soils, field trials were carried out at ten localities during four consecutive seasons. The treatments were full fertilization as reference, with the comparative treatment being where S was omitted. Relative yields were calculated as the yield of the (-S) plot expressed as a percentage of the yield of the plot (in the same replicate) which received all the nutrients including S. Composite soil samples were taken and S was extracted with monocalcium phosphate which includes SO4 and some mineralizable organic S. The results indicate that maize will respond to S fertilization when the S value is lower than the threshold value of 9 mg S kg-1 in the topsoil. A survey of soil samples submitted by farmers highlighted the importance of supplementing S in the main maize-growing areas of South Africa. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Critical levels; Maize; Relative yields; Soil; Sulphur","Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; World; Zea mays; crop yield; fertilizer application; maize; soil nutrient; sulfur; threshold","","","J.J. van Biljon; Omnia Fertilizers, Bryanston, 2021, P.O.Box 69888, United States; email: JVanBiljon@omnia.co.za","","","02571862","","","","English","S.

Nitrogen (N) fertilizer and imidazolinone resistant (IR) maize are key elements in the agronomic toolbox to control infestations and enhance yields Research question: The circumstances under which their use, individually or combined, is most effective on farmer fields have not been well documented. Inappropriate management decisions and low returns on investments arise from this knowledge gap, causing hunger and poverty in smallholder communities to persist. Methods: Experiments were carried out on 60 fields in three different agroecosystems of western Kenya using full-factorial treatments with non-herbicide treated maize (DH) and herbicide treated maize (IR), and N fertilizer omission and application. Trials were stratified on a field with low and high soil fertility within individual farms and repeated over two seasons. Results: Cultivating IR maize instead of DH maize decreased the emergence of Striga with 13 shoots m−2 on average while applying N fertilizer on DH maize led to a reduction of 5 shoots m−2 on average. Decreases of Striga by use of IR maize and N fertilizer were between 6 and 23 shoots m−2 larger at the site with high levels of infestation than at the sites with medium or low emergence. Input of N fertilizer increased grain harvests by 0.59 ton ha−1 on average while use of IR maize enhanced the productivity with 0.33 ton ha−1 on average. Use of N fertilizer had similar yield effects in all three sites, whereas use of IR maize at the site with high Striga emergence increased maize production by 0.26–0.39 ton ha−1 more than at the sites with medium or low emergence. Conclusions: The greater Striga responses to IR maize and the greater yield responses to N fertilizer demonstrate their use could be optimized according to field conditions and management goals. Combining IR maize and N fertilizer has larger added yield benefits where their individual effects on grain productivity are smaller. Significance: Findings from this study indicate that farmers in western Kenya require guidance on how to align the use of herbicide resistant maize and inorganic N inputs with the level of Striga infestation and maize yield on their fields for effectively controlling the pernicious weed and enhancing food production. © 2023 The Authors","Imidazolinone resistant maize; Soil nutrient management; Sustainable intensification; Weed control","Kenya; agricultural intensification; farm; herbicide; maize; smallholder; soil fertility; soil nutrient; weed control","IITA; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture; Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1006185); Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet, SLU","Funding text 1: This study was partly supported by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) through funding from the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs as part of its special allocation on global food security (UD40).

However, the effectiveness of balanced fertilization in strongly acid soils is unknown. We conducted nutrient omission trials on strongly acid soils in four communities in northern Ghana to quantify impact of balanced fertilization and its synergism with liming on maize productivity. We evaluated the following treatments, each with and without liming: (i) balanced fertilization (BF), which contained all essential limiting nutrients, (ii) BF without sulfur (minus-S), (iii) BF without zinc (minus-Zn), (iv) BF without boron (minus-B), (v) NPK-only, and (vi) control. Without liming, maize yield was generally low (ranging from 0.4 to 2.2 t ha−1) and followed the order: minus-Zn > NPK-only > BF = Minus-S = Minus-B > Control. However, regardless of fertilization treatment, liming significantly increased maize productivity with grain yields ranging from 0.7 to 4.2 t ha−1, with BF having the greatest yield. With liming, the minus-Zn treatment resulted in a ≥ 30% yield decrease, compared to BF. The combined data suggest that in strongly acid soils, unless lime is applied, addition of micronutrients to NPK fertilizers would not have the desired effect on maize productivity. Without lime application to such soils, omission of Zn from BF in will not only reduce production cost but could have a positive impact on maize productivity. However, we recommend that BF in strongly acid soils should be accompanied by liming to ensure increased and sustainable productivity. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agronomic nutrient use efficiency; apparent nutrient recovery efficiency; balanced fertilization; grain yield; northern Ghana; nutrient omission trials","","IFDC; International Fertilizer Development Center; Savanna Agricultural Research Institute Soil Lab; United States Agency for International Development’s Feed the Future Soil Fertility Technology Adoption, (AID-BFS-IO-15-00001)","Funding text 1: for this work was provided by the United States Agency for International Development’s Feed the Future Soil Fertility Technology Adoption, Policy Reform and Knowledge Management Project (Cooperative Agreement number AID-BFS-IO-15-00001) through the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC).

The model QUEFTS (QUantitative Evaluation of Fertility of Tropical Soils) was used to estimate balanced nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) requirements for maize production in the Northern Nigerian Savanna. Data from on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted in 2015 and 2016 rainy seasons in two agro-ecological zones in the Northern Nigerian Savanna (i.e. Northern Guinea Savanna “NGS” and Sudan Savanna “SS”) were used to parameterize and validate the QUEFTS model. The relations between indigenous soil N, P, and K supply and soil properties were not well described with the QUEFTS default equations and consequently new and better fitting equations were derived. The parameters of maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) in kg grain per kg nutrient for the QUEFTS model obtained were respectively 35 and 79 for N, 200 and 527 for P and 25 and 117 for K in the NGS zone; 32 and 79 for N, 164 and 528 for P and 24 and 136 for K in the SS zone; and 35 and 79 for N, 199 and 528 for P and 24 and 124 for K when the data of the two zones were combined. There was a close agreement between observed and parameterized QUEFTS predicted yields in each of the agro-ecological zone (R2 = 0.69 for the NGS and 0.75 for the SS). Although with a slight reduction in the prediction power, a good fit between the observed and model predicted grain yield was also detected when the data for the two agro-ecological zones were combined (R2 = 0.67). Therefore, across the two agro-ecological zones, the model predicted a linear relationship between grain yield and above-ground nutrient uptake until yield reached about 50 to 60% of the yield potential. When the yield target reached 60% of the potential yield (i.e. 6.0 t ha−1), the model showed above-ground balanced nutrient uptake of 20.7, 3.4 and 27.1 kg N, P, and K, respectively, per one tonne of maize grain. These results suggest an average NPK ratio in the plant dry matter of about 6.1:1:7.9. We concluded that the QUEFTS model can be widely used for balanced nutrient requirement estimations and development of site-specific fertilizer recommendations for maize intensification in the Northern Nigerian Savanna. © 2019 The Authors","Indigenous nutrient supply; QUEFTS model; Site-specific fertilizer recommendations; Soil fertility variability; Zea mays L.","Guinea; Nigeria; Sudan; Zea mays; agricultural intensification; agroecology; crop yield; dry matter; environmental impact assessment; fertilizer application; maize; model validation; nutrient dynamics; parameterization; profitability; savanna; soil fertility","Bayero University Kano; IITA; International Institute for Tropical Agriculture; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF, (OPP1113374)","Funding text 1: The authors appreciate the financial support for this research from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) through the project called Taking Maize Agronomy to Scale in Africa “TAMASA” (contract ID: OPP1113374).

Although soil P retention has been conventionally used to estimate the possible responses to P fertilizer applied to soils, its applicability has not been clearly confirmed at the field level. In this study, the applicability of P retention to predict the response of rice plants to P application was investigated using pot experiments with soils collected from various locations (N = 62) and on-farm experiments at two nutrient-poor sites (N = 38) in the central highlands of Madagascar. Further, we explored a simple prediction method of P retention for multiple location assessment in local farmers’ fields using an alternative property of soils collected from rice fields in the same region (N = 213). P retention was negatively correlated with the increase in rice P uptake (ΔPuptake, r = − 0.550) in the pot experiment and with the increase in yield (ΔYield, r = − 0.697) in the on-farm field experiment as a response to P application. Path analysis revealed that oxalate-extractable aluminum (Alox) content was the most important factor of P retention across all the soils, indicating that rice plants grown on soils with higher Alox and P retention are less sensitive to P application. Given its high correlation with P retention (r = 0.642) and its simplicity in measurement, we proposed the use of moisture content of air-dried soils (ωair) as a parameter to predict soil P retention. It was further confirmed that ωair had a significant negative correlation with ΔPuptake based on the pot experiment across a wide range of soil statuses (r = − 0.518). However, ωair could not clearly explain ΔYield within a small range of soil properties in the field experiment. Overall, soil P retention can predict the responses of rice plants to P application in the typical P-deficient and low-yielding lowlands in the central highlands of Madagascar, and this simple evaluation technique using air-dried soil moisture content will be helpful for the assessment of multiple rice fields on a broad scale. © 2021 The Author(s)","Fertilizer management; Lowland rice; Nutrient omission trial; Sub-Saharan Africa","Madagascar; Agriculture; Aluminum compounds; Fertilizers; Forecasting; Moisture determination; Phosphorus; Regression analysis; Soil moisture; Fertilizer management; Lowland rice; Madagascar; Nutrient omission trial; P fertilizers; P retention; Pot experiment; Rice plants; Simple++; Sub-saharan africa; crop yield; fertilizer application; moisture content; nutrient uptake; rice; soil moisture; Nutrients","Ministry of Mines and Strategic Resources; Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, MAFF, (30Y1175); Japan Prize Foundation; Japan International Cooperation Agency, JICA, (JPMJSA1608); Kochi University, KU; Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development, SATREPS","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to Ms. Mayumi Yonemura for assisting with the laboratory analysis.

Diagnostic trials were implemented in Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria and Tanzania, as part of the African Soils Information Service (AfSIS) project, to identify soil fertility constraints to crop production across various cropping systems and soil fertility conditions. In each country, one to three sites of 10 km × 10 km were included with each site having 12-31 field trials. The treatments tested included a control, an NPK treatment, three treatments in which the N, P and K nutrients were omitted one at a time from the NPK treatment, and three treatments in which secondary and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, S, Zn and B) simply referred here as multi-nutrients, manure and lime were added to the NPK. The field trials were conducted for 1-2 seasons; the test crop was maize except in Mali where sorghum was used. Nitrogen was limiting in all sites and generally the most limiting nutrient except in Sidindi (Kenya) and Kontela (Mali) where P was the most limiting. The general pattern in Kiberashi (Tanzania) shows none of the nutrients were limiting. K is mainly limiting in only one site (Mbinga) although incidences of K limitation were seen in almost all sites. Addition of multi-nutrients and manure further improved the yields of NPK in most sites. Cluster analyses revealed that maize crop in 11% of fields were highly responsive to nitrogen application, 25% (i.e., 21% poor and 4% fertile) 'non-responsive' to any nutrient or soil amendment, 28% being 'low responsive' and 36% of 'intermediate response'. This study indicates that constraints to crop production vary considerably even within a site, and that addressing limitations in secondary and micronutrients, and increasing soil carbon can improve response to fertilizers. For sustainable crop production intensification in smallholder farming systems in SSA, there is need to develop management strategies to improve efficiency of fertilizer use and of other inputs, recognizing the site-specific nutrient response patterns at various spatial scales. © 2016 The Authors.","Clustering; Crop responsiveness; Nutrient omission trial; Soil constraints; Variability","Sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays; cluster analysis; crop production; fertilizer application; maize; nitrogen; nutrient; phosphorus; potassium; smallholder; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil fertility; sorghum","African Soil Information Service; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, AGRA; Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, CIAT","This work was made possible through a grant from the Bill and Mellida Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) , for a project titled African Soil Information Service (AfSIS) (2009–2012) managed by International Center for Tropical Agriculture, CIAT .

Our objective was to develop and test the ability of the crop model LINTUL-Cassava-NPK to simulate biomass growth and yield of cassava under nutrient-limited conditions. We used experimental data from six fields located in three different agro-ecologies in Nigeria: Rainforest Zone– Ogoja and Ikom (Cross River), Rainforest Transition Zone – Ekpoma (Edo) and Guinea Savanna Zone – Otukpo (Benue) over two consecutive growing seasons from 2016 to 2018. Nutrient stress in the model was implemented by combining N, P and K nutrition indices (NI) to account for the interaction of multiple nutrient limitations for crop growth. Nutrient uptake was determined by balancing demand and supply of nutrient equivalents. We parameterized and calibrated the model using observations from an experiment conducted under optimal growing conditions in Edo during the 2016 planting season. The model was then tested with data from experiments conducted in the 2017 season in Edo, Cross River and Benue. The model captured the uptake patterns of N, P and K well. Uptakes of N, P and K, and storage root yield were predicted with a small root mean squared error of 5.1 g N m−2, 0.8 g P m−2, 3.3 g K m−2 and 308 g DM roots m−2, with an R2 of 0.7 – 0.8 for linear relationships between simulated and observed values. The time course of development of nutrient-limited yield of green leaves, stems and storage roots were simulated reasonably well. In general, the model responded aptly to both nutrient omissions and varying amounts of NPK. These findings increase our understanding of nutrient limitations and N, P and K interactions on cassava growth and yield. The model provided insight into surplus amounts of nutrients in the soil at the end of the season and, specifically, the need to balance the supply of N and K for cassava. To our knowledge, this is the first tested cassava process-based model that includes the three macro-nutrients. © 2022 The Authors","Balanced nutrition; Nutrient equivalents; Nutrient uptake rates; Potassium response; Simulation model","Benue; Cross River; Guinea; Nigeria; agroecology; biomass; cassava; crop yield; fertilizer application; growing season; nutrient limitation; nutrient use efficiency; rainforest; soil nutrient","IITA; International Institute of Tropical Agriculture; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF","The first author is grateful to the Netherlands Fellowship Program (NUFFIC) for a PhD scholarship.

One-year-on-farm research was conducted in the Amhara region to identify major determinant nutrient types for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) growth and tuber yields in Amhara region. The experiment was conducted in 2021 under rain fed conditions on eight farm fields in the Amhara region classified under three major potato-growing domains (Quarit-Yilmana Densa, Dembecha, and Baja-Sekela). A total of ten treatments (NPSZnBK, NPSZnK-B, NPSBK-Zn, NPZnBK-S, NPSZnB-K, NSZnBK-P, PSZnBK-N, NPS, NP, and control) were evaluated in the experiment. The treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and replicated three times. The improved potato variety “Gudenie (CIP-386423–13)” was used as a test crop. Urea, TSP (triple super phosphate), KCl (muriate of potash), MgSO4 (magnesium sulfate), EDTA, and Borax were used for the sources of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), and boron (B) nutrients, respectively. Except for urea, all fertilizer sources were applied once at planting, while urea was applied in three equal splits at different crop stages (planting, flowering, and tuber initiation). Before planting, one composite soil sample from each experimental site was taken at 0–20 cm depth, and analysed for some important soil parameters. Both potato yield components and biological yield (tuber yield) were taken. Marketable and total tuber yields of potato showed highly significant differences among treatment means at each experimental site as well as from combined analysis in the study domains. The main driving force for the occurrence of significant differences between treatment means in the ANOVA was due to omitting N and P nutrients. Tuber yield of potato showed quick and automatic responses to omitting N followed by omitting P. However, both marketable and total tuber yields did not show any significant differences, either due to adding or omitting S, Zn, B, and K nutrients. This showed that currently N and P nutrients are major potato yield-limiting nutrients in Amhara region, Ethiopia. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Potato Research.","Nitrogen; Nutrient; Omission; Phosphorus; Potato; Tuber yield","","Adet Agricultural Research Centre; American Association for Respiratory Care, AARC; Amhara Regional Agricultural Research Institute, ARARI","We received financial support from the Adet Agricultural Research Centre (AARC) and Amhara Agricultural Research Institute (ARARI) for the field and laboratory works.

Nutrient omission trials were conducted on 23 farms located in Sidindi, Western Kenya, selected to be representative of the main soil and management factors in maize based systems in Siaya County. Treatments included a control and PK, NK, NP and NPK applications. The trials ran for six consecutive cropping seasons, without changing treatments or plot location, covering the period 2013–2015. Strong spatial-temporal patterns in maize yield responses to N, P and K applications were observed. Average maize yields in the control, PK, NK, NP and NPK treatments were 2.8, 3.2, 5.1, 5.1 and 5.5 t ha−1 at 88% dry matter respectively in the first cropping season, and 1.1, 1.4, 2.9, 3.6 and 5.3 t ha−1 at 88% dry matter respectively in the sixth cropping season. In all seasons, variability in maize yield between fields was greatest in the control treatment followed by the NK treatment and least in the NPK treatment. Mean relative yield was 0.6, 0.92 and 0.93 for N, P and K respectively, in the first cropping season, and 0.25, 0.52 and 0.68, respectively, in the sixth cropping season. Six main maize yield response categories were identified that differed in the maize grain yield responses to recursive N, P and K applications. Maize yield responses to N, P and K were not fully accounted for by soil organic matter, soil available P and exchangeable K respectively. Our results indicate that current methods for soil analysis do not adequately predict the response to application of N, P and K fertilizer under the highly variable soil fertility conditions encountered in smallholder farming systems. The strong spatial-temporal patterns observed present major challenges for the development of effective site-specific fertilizer recommendations. Potential avenues for future research and options for more effective intensification strategies are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Nutrient omission trials; Relative yield; Soil fertility variability; Sub-Saharan africa","Kenya; Sahara; Siaya; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays; agricultural intensification; crop production; crop yield; cropping practice; dry matter; farming system; fertilizer application; maize; nutrient dynamics; smallholder; soil fertility; spatiotemporal analysis; yield response","International Plant Nutrition Institute, IPNI","This study was facilitated through funding from Agrium to the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), for research on 4R Nutrient Stewardship in western Kenya.","S.

Saccharum) was investigated on some tropical alfisols, ultisols and oxisols of Nigeria. Experimentation involved soils from 5 locations (Enugu, Rockefellar, Alabata, Barthroad and NIFOR) and 7 fertilizer treatments (Control, Complete/adequate nutrient supply, minus (-) N, -P, -K, -Ca and -Mg), replicated three times in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD). Expectedly, the soils supported crop performance to various extents associated with their fertility levels. Complete nutrient supply and-Ca treatment resulted in the highest biomass production (13.9 and 13.8 g pot-1, respectively) while the control had the least (4.9 g pot-1) followed by-N (5.3 g pot-1)and-P (10.7 g pot-1), indicative of their importance in the nutrition of the crop. The effects on crop nutrient uptake followed the same trend. Nitrogen was the least while K was the most efficiently used nutrient by the crop. Across fertiliser treatments, N use efficiency ranged between 2.4 g g-1 (NIFOR location soil) and 7.0 g g-1 (Bart road location soil). Across soil types, the range was between 2.4 g g-1(-N treatment) to 6.8 g g-1 (with complete nutrient application). Nutrient use efficiencies were highest when the elements considered are omitted in the fertiliser application schedule and/or when its initial content in the soil was low. A categorisation of efficiencies of nutrient use values (into low, medium and high levels) for the soil types was provided on the basis of the experimental data. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Alfisols; Nutrient use efficiency; Oxisol; Single element fertilizers; Soil locations; Sweet-corn; Ultisols","Saccharum; Zea mays","","","","","","18125735","","","","English","Pak.

Because of this, important crops frequently respond to fertilizer applications significantly below their achievable and potential yields. This study was carried out to determine the most sorghum yield-limiting nutrients in the Raya Kobo area of the Amhara Region in the 2020/21 crop season. Sorghum variety Girana-One was used as the test crop. Control, NPS, PSBZn, NPBZn, NSBZn, NPSB, NPSZn, NPSBZn, recommended NP, and NPSKBZn were treatments. Three replications of the experiment were used in a randomized complete block design. Before treatment application, a composite soil sample was collected at a depth of 0-20 cm to determine the soil’s physicochemical properties. To evaluate N and P uptakes, samples of sorghum stalk and grain were collected. SAS software was used to analyze the data. Results showed that, NPKSZnB produced a considerably greater grain yield (4620 kg·ha−1), whereas the control and N omitted plots produced the lowest grain yields (2759 kg·ha−1) and 2805 kg·ha−1, respectively. Nitrogen fertilizer missing plots showed a statistically significant yield drop compared to the other plots, and there was no statistically significant yield difference between the prescribed NP plots and the potassium, sulfur, boron, or zinc omitted plots. The plots treated with NPKSZnB had the highest agronomic efficiency for N (19.7 kg grain kg−1·N) and P (10.6 kg grain kg−1 P2O5). Therefore, research and development should therefore concentrate on nitrogen to achieve the best sorghum yield for the study location. Phosphorus might also be used to keep the fertility level within the ideal range. Copyright © 2023 Habtemariam Teshome et al.","","","","","H.

A study was designed to determine the effect of omitting nutrients on potato growth, yield and harvest index. On-farm nutrient omission trials were set during the long rains (LR) and short rains (SR) of 2016 in which the treatments involve the judicious omission of N, P, K, S and B. Additional two treatments were included with one receiving all the nutrients and a control where no nutrients were added. The treatment was laid in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Potato yields reduced by 6.6 and 11.2 t ha−1 in N-omitted treatments in LR and SR, respectively, when compared to the one receiving all the nutrients, while omitting P resulted in respective yield reductions of 3.8 and 2.0 t ha−1. Stability analysis revealed that omission of N was more stable with a regression coefficient of 0.5; it was followed by P with a value of 1. Potassium, S and B were limiting nutrients only in some farms. N and P should continue to be included in potato nutrient management, while K, S and B should be added based on soil test. © 2021 The Author(s).

Relying solely on the standard financial analysis undermines the actual benefit of soybean production, which often results in ineffectual policy designs. An economic analysis that incorporates key non-pecuniary co-benefits of soybean production provide vital insight that contributes to improving productivity and overall economic well-being of farmers. Cross-sectional data were collected from 271 farmers to estimate the overall economic benefit of soybean that captures both market and non-market attributes in three major producing districts (Sissala-West, Wa-East, and Dafiama-Busie-Issa (DBI)) of Ghana. Results: When non-market co-benefits were omitted, soybean production was not profitable (−Gh¢103.10/ha or −US$22.91) in DBI while Sissala-West and Wa-East had modest profit margins. However, the financial analysis changed dramatically when an average non-market value of Gh¢345.69 (US$76.82) was incorporated in the analysis. The soybean system was, therefore, financially viable for all the districts when the non-market attributes of the crop were considered. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate the importance of the non-pecuniary benefits of soybean in smallholder farming systems for policy decision-making. For instance, farmers’ motivation for soybean production is closely linked to those ancillary benefits like the biological nitrogen fixed in the soil for cultivation of other crops. Similarly, crop administrators and policy makers’ support for conservation agriculture and green environment is tied to these non-market co-benefits. © 2020, The Author(s).","Economic analysis; Food security; Non-market benefits; Smallholder farming systems sustainability; Soybean","","International Food Policy Research Institute; TUDRIDEP","Funding text 1: We express our sincere gratitude to the staff of the Department of Agriculture in the Sissala West, Wa East and Dafiama-Busie-Issa districts of Ghana for their immense contribution during the data collection process.

On-farm trials were established in Eastern Zimbabwe to assess the effects of tillage systems on maize grain yields under rain-fed conditions across a soil organic matter gradient. The study compared the effects of a) conventional tillage (CT), b) basins-based CA (B-CA), and c) furrow-based CA (F-CA) on sandy soils with contrasting soil organic carbon (SOC). Fields had SOC ranging from 0.18 to 0.89% and clay content from 60 to 150 g kg−1. A nutrient omission trial using nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), cattle manure (M) and their combinations was set up on twenty farms each with two fields selected by the host farmer as either poor or rich in soil fertility in Study 1, and ten farms in Study 2, each with two fields selected as in Study 1. Fields selected by farmers as poor fields had SOC <0.4%, were more acidic, had lower amounts of exchangeable bases (Mg, Ca, K), available P and total N. These lab-based results corroborated well with farmers’ local rating of soil fertility. For Study 1, nutrient management significantly increased maize yields across the three years (P < 0.001) but there were no significant tillage effects observed. Grain yields increased from 0.3 Mg ha−1 for unfertilized control to 4.1 Mg ha−1 for the NPKSM treatment. Yield response to N was consistently larger than for P or K, irrespective of soil fertility status. Response to N increased with increase in soil fertility, suggesting higher N use efficiency for soils with higher SOC. Except for NPKSM, no significant yield differences were observed under the residual and additive plots for treatments, when N was added each year. At productivity levels of <4 Mg ha−1, there was no yield gain in applying both P and K for consecutive years, suggesting that nutrient investments by resource constrained farmers for Year 2 could target only N application. For Study 2, maize grain yields were significantly higher under B-CA compared with both F-CA and CT in the second year (P < 0.01). The consistently larger NPKSM yields highlight the importance of integrated nutrient management, combining mineral and organic sources of nutrients to ensure maize productivity on poor soils in agro-ecologies receiving unreliable rainfall. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation agriculture; Conventional tillage; Crop productivity; Maize fertilization; Smallholder systems","Zimbabwe; Bos; Zea mays; alternative agriculture; comparative study; conservation tillage; crop production; crop yield; cropping practice; fertilizer application; food security; integrated approach; maize; rainfed agriculture; sandy soil; smallholder; soil fertility; soil organic matter; yield response","United States Agency for International Development, USAID; International Plant Nutrition Institute, IPNI; University of Zimbabwe","Funding text 1: This research was supported by funds from the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) to the University of Zimbabwe.

Despite Azolla’s well-known role as a nitrogen-fixing aquatic fern in rice production, its specific impact on PUE remains unclear. The primary objective is to explore diverse treatment combinations to identify synergies that enhance both PUE and overall rice productivity. Methods: The study was conducted at Mkula Irrigation Scheme in the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania; the field experiment employed a randomized complete block design with 13 treatments and three replications. Treatments comprised various combinations of Azolla, rice straw, and chemical fertilizers, incorporating 50% and 100% rates of nitrogen (N) applied with phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S). Results: The study reveals the substantial impact of Azolla application on total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium levels in the soil. Particularly noteworthy were treatment combinations involving Azolla, rice straw, and reduced rates of synthetic nitrogen, along with specific P, K, and S applications, which exhibited the highest phosphorus uptake and PUE. Specifically, combining rice straw and Azolla with reduced N rates, alongside 30 kg P ha−1 + 30 kg K ha−1 + 20 kg S ha−1, resulted in the highest phosphorus uptake (73.57 kg/ha) and PUE (46.24%). Conclusion: Integrated nutrient management, incorporating rice straw and Azolla alongside synthetic fertilizers, demonstrates synergistic effects on phosphorus uptake and efficiency while maintaining soil quality. The study underscores the potential of such integrated strategies to optimize PUE and contribute to sustainable rice production in lowland paddy fields.

In a two-year nutrient omission trial in 12 locations within the Sudan savanna and Guinea savanna AEZs of northern Ghana, we quantified maize yield increases resulting from addition of secondary and micronutrients from the NPK-only fertilization practice for maize production in the two AEZs. In both years, applying only NPK fertilizer resulted in average yields of 3.6 t ha − 1 and 2.5 t ha − 1 in the Guinea savanna and Sudan savanna AEZs, respectively. However, addition of sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), and boron (B) to the NPK fertilizers (“balanced” fertilization) resulted in an average of 60% and 64% yield increases over those of the NPK-only treatment in the Sudan savanna and Guinea savanna AEZs, respectively. Compared to balanced fertilization, omission of S, Zn, and B reduced grain yield by an average of ∼34%, ∼28%, and ∼14%, respectively. The combined data suggest that, even though secondary- and micronutrients are needed in small quantities by plants relative to N, P, and K, they have an enormous effect on crop productivity. Therefore, to ensure sustainably increased maize productivity in the savanna agroecological zones of northern Ghana, fertilizer recommendations should not be restricted to only NPK fertilizers but all limiting secondary- and micronutrients must be accounted for in a holistic and balanced fertilizer recommendation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agronomic nutrient use efficiency; apparent nutrient recovery efficiency; balanced fertilization; grain yield; northern Ghana; nutrient omission trials","","Albert Angzenaa; Alhaji Rahman Issahaku; Emmanuel K.M.

Field-specific P management is key for resource-limited farmers to increase yields with minimal inputs. We used soil P fractionation analysis to identify the relevant factors controlling P uptake and the responses to P fertilization of rice in flooded and highly weathered soils. Methods: Phytometric pot-based experiments and a modified Hedley fractionation analysis were repeated for soils from extensive regions and from geographically adjacent fields in Madagascar. Results: Large field-to-field variations in indigenous P supply from soils (total P uptake of rice when P is omitted) and fertilizer-P recovery efficiencies (increased P uptake when P is applied) were observed not only for soils with various geological backgrounds but also for soils from adjacent fields. Regression models indicated that the indigenous P supply in soils was largely controlled by readily available inorganic and organic P pools (r                             2                              = 0.72), whereas fertilizer-P recovery efficiencies were controlled by the abundance of oxalate-extractable aluminum and iron in soils (r                             2                              = 0.81). Conclusions: Spatial heterogeneity even within adjacent fields leads to benefits from field-specific fertilizer management based on indigenous P supply from soils and fertilizer-P recovery efficiencies evaluated by different soil properties.                          © 2018, The Author(s).","Hedley fractionation; Nutrient omission trial; Phosphorus uptake; Rice; Sub-Saharan Africa","Madagascar; Sub-Saharan Africa; agricultural management; crop plant; crop yield; fertilizer application; nutrient uptake; phosphorus; physicochemical property; rice; soil property; tropical soil","Japan Science and Technology Agency, JST; Japan International Cooperation Agency, JICA; Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development, SATREPS","Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Dr. Patrick E.

This variability affects fertilizer use efficiency and crop productivity. Therefore, development of decision systems that support formulation and delivery of site-specific fertilizer recommendations is important for increased crop yield and environmental protection. Nutrient Expert (NE) is a computer-based decision support system, which enables extension advisers to generate field- or area-specific fertilizer recommendations based on yield response to fertilizer and nutrient use efficiency. We calibrated NE for major maize agroecological zones in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, with data generated from 735 on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted between 2015 and 2017. Between 2016 and 2018, 368 NE performance trials were conducted across the three countries in which recommendations generated with NE were evaluated relative to soil-test based recommendations, the current blanket fertilizer recommendations and a control with no fertilizer applied. Although maize yield response to fertilizer differed with geographic location; on average, maize yield response to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were respectively 2.4, 1.6 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Nigeria, 2.3, 0.9 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Ethiopia, and 1.5, 0.8 and 0.2 t ha−1 in Tanzania. Secondary and micronutrients increased maize yield only in specific areas in each country. Agronomic use efficiencies of N were 18, 22 and 13 kg grain kg−1 N, on average, in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, respectively. In Nigeria, NE recommended lower amounts of P by 9 and 11 kg ha−1 and K by 24 and 38 kg ha−1 than soil-test based and regional fertilizer recommendations, respectively. Yet maize yield (4 t ha−1) was similar among the three methods. Agronomic use efficiencies of P and K (300 and 250 kg kg−1, respectively) were higher with NE than with the blanket recommendation (150 and 70 kg kg−1). In Ethiopia, NE and soil-test based respectively recommended lower amounts of P by 8 and 19 kg ha−1 than the blanket recommendations, but maize yield (6 t ha−1) was similar among the three methods. Overall, fertilizer recommendations generated with NE maintained high maize yield, but at a lower fertilizer input cost than conventional methods. NE was effective as a simple and cost-effective decision support tool for fine-tuning fertilizer recommendations to farm-specific conditions and offers an alternative to soil testing, which is hardly available to most smallholder farmers. © 2020 The Authors","Fertilizer recommendations; Maize intensification; Nutrient use efficiency; Smallholder farming systems; Soil fertility management; Yield response","Africa; Ethiopia; Nigeria; Sub-Saharan Africa; Tanzania; Zea mays; agricultural intensification; agroecology; crop yield; decision support system; ecozone; farming system; fertilizer application; maize; nutrient use efficiency; soil fertility; yield response","Bayero University Kano in Nigeria; Centre for Dryland Agriculture; Ethiopia Institute of Agricultural Research; IITA; International Fertilizer Industry Association; International Institute for Tropical Agriculture; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; International Plant Nutrition Institute, IPNI; Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, EIAR","This research was mainly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation under a project ""Taking Maize Agronomy to scale in Africa (TAMASA)"", which had been implemented by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI), the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Centre for Dryland Agriculture (CDA) at Bayero University Kano in Nigeria, Ethiopia Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR), and Tari-Uyole and -Selian Agricultural Research Institutes in Tanzania.

The effect on rice grain yield (GY) and nutrient content of complete fertilizer (Fc with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn)) was compared with Fc from which a specific nutrient was excluded (Fc - N, Fc - P, Fc - K, Fc - Ca, Fc - Mg and Fc - Zn). Before the trial, soil K (0.10 cmol kg-1) and Mg (0.20 cmol kg-1) contents were suitable, but available P-Bray I (4.2 mg kg-1) was found to be deficient. In course of the study, K, Mg and P deficiencies were observed. An antagonistic effect was observed between rice GY and grain concentrations in P, Mg and Ca for treatments Fc - Mg, Fc - P and Fc - K, respectively. Therefore, the use of P, K and Mg fertilizers is recommended for successive cropping seasons in order to rich stable and high rice yield while decreasing of grain concentrations in P, Mg and Ca can be observed. © 2013 © Taylor & Francis.","foot slope; grain yield and quality; nutrient constraints; rice; soil fertility","","","","B.

The availability of extensive data (n = 1,781) from 2-yr nutrient omission trials in the most suitable agroecological zone for maize (Zea mays L.) in Nigeria (i.e., the northern Guinea savanna) provides an opportunity to assess nutrient limitations and imbalances using the concept of multi-ratio compositional nutrient diagnosis (CND). We also compared and contrasted the use of linear regression models and bootstrap forest machine learning to predict maize yield based on nutrient concentration in ear leaves. The results showed that 35% of the experimental plots had low yields due to nutrient imbalances (hereafter referred to as low yield imbalanced [LYI]). These experimental plots were dominated by control plots (without any nutrients applied), plots without N fertilization, and plots without P fertilization. Using the control plot as the ultimate indicator of nutrient imbalance, the significantly limiting nutrients in order of decreasing frequency of deficiency were N, P, S, Ca > Cu, and B. Both linear regression and bootstrap forest machine learning models fairly predicted maize grain yield based on nutrient concentration in ear leaves only in the LYI group and when examining all data with an independent validation dataset. These results suggest that nutrient management strategies, especially through the site-specific management approach, should consider S, Ca, Cu, and B in addition to the existing nutrients N, P, and K to improve nutrient balance and maize yield in the study area. © 2022 The Authors.

To derive these parameters, and understand their variability, as well as yield responses and fertilizer use profitability, nutrient omission trials (NOTs) were conducted in farmers’ fields across different agro-ecologies in Bako (n = 37), Central Rift Valley (CRV) (n = 66) and Jimma (n = 44) regions of Ethiopia in the main crop growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. The treatments used in the NOTs were control, PK, NK, NP, NPK and NPKSM, where SM refers to secondary and micro nutrients, and applied levels of N, P and K, were 120, 40 and 40 kg /ha, respectively. The results showed that the average yields of the control treatment were 4.5, 3.1 and 2.9 t/ha in Bako, CRV and Jimma, whereas the average yields for the NPK treatment were 8.3, 4.9 and 7.9 t/ha in the respective regions. Nitrogen was limiting grain yield in all the three regions, whereas P limited yield only in CRV and Jimma. The average N agronomic efficiencies in Bako, CRV and Jimma were 25.7, 13.3 and 35.5 kg grain kg−1 of applied N, respectively, under NPK fertilizer use. With the levels of fertilizer used in the NOTs, NK, NP and NPK treatments were profitable in Bako and Jimma, whereas PK was not. None of the fertilizer treatments were profitable in CRV. Soils in Bako and Jimma supplied more N and K but less P than the soils in CRV. The PUE at maximum accumulation, median and maximum dilution of N were 27, 54 and 80 kg grain kg-1 N, while for P, the values were estimated to be 194, 350 and 505 kg grain kg-1 P, and for K they were 16, 52 and 87 kg grain kg−1 K. The estimated average N, P and K recovery fractions were 0.29, 0.05 and 0.06, respectively, in Bako, 0.22, 0.10 and 0.15 in CRV, and 0.38, 0.10 and 0.01 in Jimma. While these average parameter values are relevant, in particular agronomic use efficiencies and recovery fractions showed large variability and, moreover, averages were lower than what is deemed feasible with good agronomy. We discuss the variability in the derived parameters, the relation with yield levels, soil nutrient supply and rainfall, and conclude that caution is needed when deriving fertilizer recommendations from parameters obtained in on-farm experiments. Using single estimated average values is not sufficient: variability in these parameters and sub-optimum values need to be explained first, and derived insight should be used when developing site-specific fertilizer recommendations. © 2021 The Authors","Agronomic efficiency; Fertilizer use profitability; Nutrient omission trial; Site-specific fertilizer recommendation; Soil nutrient supply; Target yield","","CIMMYT-Ethiopia; I nternational Fertilizer Association; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; International Plant Nutrition Institute, IPNI","The authors acknowledge the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for its financial support to establish trials in Bako and Jimma regions, through Taking Maize Agronomy to Scale in Africa (TAMASA) project, CIMMYT-Ethiopia.

However, it is unclear on which soils Zn fertilisation can lead to higher yields and increased grain Zn concentrations. This study aimed to find soil properties that predict where soil Zn is limiting maize yields and grain Zn concentrations, and where these respond positively to Zn fertilisation. Methods: Zinc omission trials were set up at multiple farm locations in Kenya (n = 5), Zambia (n = 4) and Zimbabwe (n = 10). Grain yields and tissue Zn concentrations were analysed from plots with a full fertiliser treatment as compared to plots where Zn was omitted. Results: A positive maize yield response to soil Zn fertilisation was found at only two out of nineteen locations, despite soil Zn levels being below suggested critical concentrations at most locations. Soil properties nor plant concentrations were able to explain maize yield response to Zn fertilisation. However, positive responses in Zn uptake and grain Zn concentrations to Zn fertilisation were found at the majority of sites, especially in soils with low pH and organic carbon contents. Labile soil Zn measurements related more with Zn uptake (R2 = 0.35) and grain Zn concentrations (R2 = 0.26) than actual available Zn measurements. Conclusions: We conclude that soil Zn fertilisation did not increase maize yields, but can increase maize grain Zn concentrations, especially in soils with low pH and organic carbon content. Predicting a yield response to Zn fertilisation based on soil properties remains a challenge. © 2023, The Author(s).","Agronomic biofortification; Maize; Soil tests; Yield response; Zinc","Kenya; Zambia; Zimbabwe; agronomy; crop yield; fertilizer application; food quality; maize; nutritional status; soil test; yield response; zinc","Foundation for Cross-cultural; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO, (14688)","Funding text 1: This work was supported by NWO (grant number 14688, ‘‘Micronutrients for better yields”).

However, the response of major cereals to fertilizer applications is often far below the potential yields. Low fertilizer efficiency, inadequacy of current fertilizer recommendations, and the ignorance of nutrients other than N, P, and K may limit crop production. Nutrient limitations to maize production were identified in on-farm trials in Togo and in several long-term experiments in Nigeria and Benin. Maize ear leaf samples were analyzed for macro and micro-nutrients, and the Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated Systems (DRIS) was applied to rank nutrients according to their degree of limitation to maize. In the on-farm trials, both yield and DRIS results indicated that, when N is supplied, P limited maize production in all fields, reducing yields by 31% on average. Sulfur was limiting in 81% of the fields and was responsible for an average yield reduction of 20%. In the long-term experiments where N, P, and K had been annually applied, Ca and Mg indices were strongly negative, indicative of deficiency. Zn indices were negative in all trials. Despite N-fertilizer additions, N indices remained negative in some of the long-term experiments, pointing to low efficiency of applied fertilizers. There was a direct link between DRIS indices and the management imposed in the different experiments, indicating that DRIS is a useful approach to reveal nutrient deficiencies or imbalances in maize in the region. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","DRIS; Ear leaves; Fertilizers; Nutrient indices; Organic inputs","Africa; Benin [West Africa]; Nigeria; Sub-Saharan Africa; Togo; West Africa; Zea mays; crop production; crop yield; experimental study; fertilizer application; leaf; maize; nutrient limitation; savanna; soil fertility; sulfur; yield response","Belgian Doctorate General for Development Cooperation; DGDC","Acknowledgements The authors are very grateful to the Belgian Doctorate General for Development Cooperation (DGDC) for funding the balanced nutrient management project under which this work was conducted.

Field experiments were conducted at Ndiaye and Fanaye (Senegal) during the hot and dry season 2012 and the wet season 2012 to evaluate the effect of nitrogen on rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency under phosphorus and potassium omission management. Five rates of nitrogen (0, 60, 90, 120 and 150 kg/ha) were associated with P (26 kg P/ha); or P-K (26 kg P/ha and 50 kg K/ha). Four aromatic rice varieties Pusa Basmati, Sahel 329, Sahel 177 and Sahel 328 and a non-aromatic variety Sahel 108 were evaluated. Results showed that across genotypes, rice yield varied from 3.3 to 8.6 Mg/ha under N-P fertilizer and from 3.5 to 8.8 Mg/ha under N-P-K fertilizer at Ndiaye. At Fanaye, rice yield varied from 3.7 to 8.6 Mg/ha under N-P fertilizer and from 3 to 10.3 Mg/ha under N-P-K fertilizer. The highest grain yield was obtained by Sahel 177 among the aromatic rice varieties. The optimum nitrogen dose varied with rice genotype and location. The PFPN and the ANUE were influenced by genotype and varied from 161 to 28 kg grain/kg N and from 105.9 to 0.9 kg grain/kg N, respectively. The highest PFPN was obtained by Sahel 108 followed by Sahel 177. K addition to N-P significantly increased ANUE from 6.4 to 20.78 kg grain/kg N.

In Ethiopia, fertilizer application during the last four decades has led to significant yield gains, yet yield remains below its potential across much of the country. One of the main challenges responsible for low yield response to fertilizer application has been the use of 'blanket' recommendations, whereby no tailoring of fertilizer amount and frequency is done based on soil requirements. As a result, the amount of fertilizer applied ranges widely, and can be either sub- or supra-optimal. There is thus an increasing need for site-specific fertilizer recommendations which take into account site characteristics such as climate variables (temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation); soil factors (soil organic carbon, moisture, pH, texture, cation exchange capacity, and level of macro- and micronutrients); and topographic position indices. This article reports on a data-mining approach we developed on a large dataset of 6585 wheat (Triticum aestivum) field trials. The dataset includes detailed, site-specific biophysical variables to create nutrient response functions that can guide optimal site-specific fertilizer application. The approach used a machine-learning model (random forest) to capture the relationship between nutrients - nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) - and wheat yield. The model explained about 83, 82, 47, and 69% of variances of yield for N, P, K, and S omission, respectively, with consistent performance across training and testing datasets. Expectedly, for N and P omission data, the most important explanatory variables are nutrient rate, followed by soil organic carbon and soil pH. For K and S, however, climatic variables played an important role alongside nutrient rates. The site-specific yield-fertilizer response curves derived from our model are highly variable from location to location, as they are affected by the climatic, soil, or topographic conditions of the site. Importantly, using principal component analysis, we showed that the shape of the fertilizer response curves is a result of the multiple environmental factors (including soil, topography, and climate) that are at play at a given site, rather than of a specific dominant one. The research output is expected to respond to the national policy demands for a sound method to identify the optimal fertilizer rate to increase economic returns of fertilizer investments and take fertilizer utilization research one step further.  © The Author(s), 2022.

In this study, the most limiting nutrients for legume growth were determined in soils where the crops had not responded to P and rhizobial inoculation in field trials, using the double pot technique. Soils were collected from 17 farmers' fields in West Kenya, Northern Nigeria, Eastern and Southern Rwanda, South-west and North-west Sierra Leone. Plant growth and mean biomass were measured on soils to which a full nutrient solution, containing phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S) and micronutrients (MN) were added, and which were compared to a control (no nutrient added), and individual omissions of each nutrient. The relationship between soil properties and nutrient deficiencies was explored. Nutrient limitations were found to differ between soils, both within and across countries. Generally, each soil was potentially deficient in at least one nutrient, with K, P, Mg, MN and S emerging as most limiting in 88, 65, 59, 18, and 12% of tested soils, respectively. While K was the most limiting nutrient in soils from Kenya and Rwanda, P was most limiting in soils from Nigeria. P and K were equally limiting in soils from Sierra Leone. Mg was found limiting in two soils from Kenya and three soils from Rwanda and one soil each in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Micronutrients were found to be limiting in one soil from Nigeria and one soil from Rwanda. Estimates of nutrient deficiency using growth and mean biomass were found to be correlated with each other although the latter proved to be a more sensitive measure of deficiency. With few exceptions, the relation between soil parameters and nutrient deficiencies was weak and there were no significant relations between deficiency of specific nutrients and the soil content of these elements. Although our results cannot be translated directly to the field, they confirm that individual and multiple nutrient deficiencies were common in these “non-responsive” soils and may have contributed to reported low yields. This highlights the need for balanced nutrition in legume production in SSA.

We sought to establish efficient strategies for use of nutrient resources so as to narrow the yield gap in maize production on heterogeneous light-textured soils under rain-fed conditions in Eastern Zimbabwe. A nutrient omission study was implemented during two cropping seasons, across six on-farm sites with soil organic carbon (SOC) ranging from 3.5 to 8.9gkg-1, and clay content between 4 and 19%. Treatments used were: (i) a zero fertilizer control, (ii) NK, (iii) NPS, (iv) PKS, and (v) NPKS. Rainfall water productivity, RWP, (kggrainmm-1) was used as a proxy for water use efficiency for the different nutrient combinations. During both seasons, only 70kgha-1 N could be applied across all sites as prolonged mid-season droughts forced withholding of the second N topdressing targeted at maize anthesis. Maize productivity was influenced by both nutrient management and initial soil fertility. During the first season, maize yields across sites ranged from 0.25 to 0.84tha-1 for the control and 2.05-3.75tha-1 for the NPKS treatment that represented attainable yields. The corresponding RWP were 0.38-1.13kggrainmm-1 for the control and 3.15-7.66kggrainmm-1 for the NPKS treatment. For the second season, maize yields for the control ranged from 0.2 to 1.2tha-1, while those for the NPKS treatments ranged from 2.4 to 3.60tha-1. Across sites, response to N ranged 1.2-2.35tha-1, response to P ranged 0.71-2.10tha-1 and response to K ranged 0.08-0.30tha-1, indicating little response to K. Overall, balanced nutrient management has an overriding effect on maize grain and water productivity, but only for soils with SOC>4gkg-1 soil. Nitrogen and P remain the most limiting nutrients, in contrast, addition of K did not enhance grain yield, nor did it influence response to N or P. Variable N application strategies must be an integral component of farmer management if losses related to fertilizer investment are to be minimised under the risky rain-fed crop production systems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Maize; Nutrient use efficiency; Sandy soils; Soil carbon; Soil variability","Zimbabwe; Zea mays; crop production; crop yield; fertilizer application; growing season; maize; nutrient use efficiency; smallholder; soil fertility; water use efficiency","USAID-funded; International Plant Nutrition Institute, IPNI; International Foundation for Science, IFS; University of Zimbabwe, UZ","The Research for this work was supported through funding from the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) to the University of Zimbabwe as well as part funding from the International Foundation for Sciences (IFS) .

However, nutrient management is often challenging, especially on infertile sandy soils. This study tested whether typical nutrient management limits the productivity and sustainability of perennial forage grass systems on sandy soils. Methods: Nutrient balances were estimated for four fields of either Megathyrsus maximus cv. Tanzania or Urochloa hybrid Mulato II. Nutrient limitations were then evaluated in a nutrient omission experiment. Results: All soils were sandy (< 10% clay), neutral to acidic (pH (CaCl2) 4.6 to 6.7) and had plant-limiting concentrations of total nitrogen, extractable potassium and extractable sulfur. Nitrogen inputs were typically higher than outputs, with balances ranging from −16 kg ha−1 yr−1 to 293 kg ha−1 yr−1, yet concentrations in forage shoots were low at all sites. Phosphorus balances ranged from −5 kg ha−1 yr−1 to 77 kg ha−1 yr−1 and concentrations in forage shoots were adequate. Potassium inputs were low, resulting in balances from −79 kg ha−1 yr−1 to −138 kg ha−1 yr−1 at locations that did not apply inorganic potassium fertilizer. Potassium concentrations in forage shoots were low and omission of potassium resulted in severely depressed biomass production. Inorganic sulfur fertilizers were not applied to forages and the sulfur balance varied from −1 kg ha−1 yr−1 to −24 kg ha−1 yr−1. Sulfur concentrations in shoots were correspondingly low and production was depressed when sulfur was omitted in the experiment. Conclusion: Balanced nutrition was not achieved, despite substantial fertilizer inputs, resulting in deficiencies of potassium and sulfur, inefficient use of nitrogen and excesses of phosphorus. If current practices continue, potassium and sulfur depletion, phosphorus accumulation and soil acidification can be expected. Recommendations for balanced nutrient management that accounts for high rates of removal in biomass, variable concentrations in organic fertilizers, and leaching potential, are needed to sustain the productivity of perennial forages on tropical sandy soils. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Brachiaria; Cambodia; Fertilizer; Forage; Megathyrsus; Nutrient balance; Nutrient omission; Panicum; Sands; Urochloa","Tanzania; Brachiaria; Panicum; Poaceae; Urochloa; acidification; biomass; fertilizer; forage; grass; leaching; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; smallholder; sulfur","Cambodian Agricultural Research and Development Institute; Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR, (SMCN.2012.075)","Funding text 1: The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research provided funding for this research through project SMCN.2012.075.

Site-specific fertiliser recommendations are rarely used in the farming systems of Ethiopia. There is also a lack of data to develop or validate decision support tools for targeting specific crop production. A study was conducted for three consecutive rainy seasons (2016-2018) in the maize belt of the north-western parts of the Amhara National Regional State of Ethiopia. The objectives were to obtain the maximum achievable yield potential of maize, determine the most yield-limiting nutrients and create a database of maize responses to applied nutrients so that decision support tools could be developed for the study areas. Treatments were individual nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K)) and combinations of the three. In some treatments, NPK was also combined with sulphur, zinc, lime and compost. Two hybrid maize varieties (BH-540 and BH-660) adaptable to the study areas were used. BH-540 was used for the Mecha district, while BH-660 was used for the south Achefer, Jabitahnan-Burrie-Womberma districts. Maize yield increased by more than 50% due to fertiliser applications compared to without fertiliser. The study showed that the possibility of increasing maize productivity to more than 12 t ha-1 for the study sites. The most yield-limiting nutrient in the study sites was N, followed by P; K was not a yield limiting. Without N the yield of both varieties was non-significant from the control (without added nutrients). Maize grain yield did not respond to application of lime, compost, zinc and sulphur. The result also showed very high variability across sites, indicating that it is important for policymakers, farmers and investors to consider site-specific fertiliser recommendations. Finally, a database containing intensive plant response to NPK for maize was generated and could be used as input in site-specific decision support tools development.  © The Author(s), 2022.

A reciprocal soil origin-rice cultivar transplant experiment was also conducted to better understand the relative contributions of the soil origin and the rice cultivar in rice nutrient limitation. We tested the deficiency of seven major and secondary nutrients [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and silicon (Si)] and a solution of six micronutrients (B, Mn, Cu, Co, Na, Mo) likely to limit the growth of two upland rice cultivars, Chhomrong Dan and Nerica 4, on two Ferralsols from the highlands of Madagascar. We found severe multiple nutrient deficiencies. For both cultivars, P, Ca, N, Mg omission significantly depressed the shoot and root dry biomass and their amounts in plant tissues. However, the main limiting nutrients were not the same in both soils. We conclude that the multinutrient deficiencies observed for rice growth in the Ferralsols are site-specific, even though P limitation appears to be in common, and requires a holistic consideration of the mineral fertility, including micronutrients. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","ferralsols; Greenhouse trial; Madagascar; nutrient limitation; rice cultivars; upland rainfed rice","","Agropolis Fondation, AF, (1605-007, ANR-10-LABX-0001-01, ANR-16-IDEX-0006)","This study was funded by the project SECuRE (Soil ecological function restoration to enhance agrosystem services in rainfed rice cropping systems in agroecological transition), supported by the Agropolis Foundation under the reference ID 1605-007 through the “Investissements d’Avenir” program (Labex Agro: ANR-10-LABX-0001-01) under the framework I-SITE MUSE (ANR-16-IDEX-0006).","J.
